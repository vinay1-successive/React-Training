  Question1:
    "1.Create a React application that has multiple pages represented as components. Implement lazy loading for these components using React's lazy and Suspense features. When a user navigates to a particular page, the component should be loaded lazily, improving the application's initial loading time.",
  Question2:
    "2.Extend Question 1 to include error handling. If a lazy-loaded component fails to load, display a user-friendly error message to the user instead of crashing the application. Implement this using the ErrorBoundary component.",
  Question3:
    "3.Create a React component named Counter that displays a number and two buttons, one for incrementing the number and another for decrementing it. Write tests using React Testing Library to ensure that the component behaves as expected.",
  Question4:
    "4.You are given a simple form component (LoginForm) that contains input fields for username and password, as well as a submit button. Create test cases to verify that the form fields can be filled, and the submit button works correctly.",
  Question5:
    "5.Implement a React component (UserProfile) that displays user profile information such as name, email, and phone number. Write tests to ensure that the user profile information is correctly displayed when the component receives user data as props.",
  Question6:
    "6.Create a React component (Modal) that displays a modal dialog with content. Users can open and close the modal. Write tests to check if the modal opens and closes when triggered.",
